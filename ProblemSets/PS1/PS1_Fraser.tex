    Summary of Interests

\paragraph{}A summary of my econ interests: Economics of women, minorities, the unbanked and under-banked of America, discrimination, the housing supply crisis, and general banking. 

In terms of data science: analyzing, data scraping, programming, and finding truth(s) in big data.

What made me want to take this class is an interest in data science. I am interested in an introduction to data science, learning more about what tools we can use to analyze, and more about how to use them.

I do not have my idea for my project yet but I am thinking about it every day. I am hoping for a project in the banking realm. Possibly looking at trends of the underbanked or unbanked, I'm still thinking on it. 

My goal for this class is to learn as much as I can in 16 weeks. I would like to do a good project this semester. 

My plan is to convert to a Financial Institute Specialist with the FDIC, become a commissioned bank examiner, and then eventually I will apply for economist position at FDIC, SBA or the US Census.
